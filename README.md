# UIRemoteViewControllerService-Template
A template for Theos to use UIRemoveViewController's services in tweaks.

This template is based on pixelomer's research of UIRemoteViewControllers. You can read his research here: https://github.com/pixelomer/RemoteViewFun/.

# How to install this template?

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tr1Fecta-7/UIRemoteViewControllerService-Template.git
```

Copy the `Tr1Fecta_Tweak_With_UIRemoteViewService.nic.tar` to `$THEOS/templates/ios/tr1fecta`. If the folder tr1fecta does not exist, create it yourself.

# How do I use this template?

Run ``$THEOS/bin/nic.pl`` as usual and choose the option: `Tr1Fecta/Tweak_With_UIRemoteViewService`

The template has an example and comments included. That should be all that you need.
